# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Watcher CLI API

Threat Watcher is a CLI-based threat intelligence tool that interfaces with the [ThreatFox API](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/) to allow users to **query and submit Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**. It is deployed on multiple HTTP servers behind a **load balancer** and is accessible via web browsers or `curl` with user-friendly, human-readable output.

## Deployment Overview

- Implemented as a Python CLI server using `http.server`.
- Deployed on multiple servers (e.g., Web01, Web02) with an **HAProxy** load balancer (Lb01).
- Accepts HTTP `GET` requests and returns plain text (not JSON).
- Designed to maintain the CLI feel through HTTP endpoints.

## Features

- üîç Query IOCs by:
  - ID
  - Keyword (IP or domain)
  - File hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
  - Malware family
- üß´ Fetch recent IOCs
- üß† Retrieve known malware families
- üì§ Submit new IOCs to ThreatFox
- üìÉ Human-readable output (formatted plain text)

---

## üì° Endpoints

All endpoints are `GET` requests and return plain text responses.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/` | Health check |
| `/recent_iocs?days=3` | Get recent IOCs from the past N days (1‚Äì7) |
| `/ioc_by_id?id=123456` | Get IOC details by ID |
| `/ioc_by_keyword?keyword=badsite.com&exact_match=true` | Search IOCs by IP/domain |
| `/ioc_by_hash?hash=<your_hash>` | Search IOC by file hash |
| `/malware_list` | Get list of known malware families |
| `/ioc_by_malware?family=ZLoader&limit=20` | Get IOCs related to a malware family |
| `/submit_ioc?...` | Submit a new IOC (see below) |

### Submitting IOCs

Example submission format:

/submit_ioc?ioc_type=domain&iocs=malicious.site&threat_type=phishing&malware=ZLoader&confidence=85&comment=Seen+in+open+phishing+campaign


Required fields:
- `ioc_type` (domain, ip, url, md5, sha1, sha256)
- `iocs` (the actual indicator)
- `threat_type` (e.g., phishing, malware)
- `malware` (name of malware family)
- `confidence` (0‚Äì100)
- `comment` (optional)

### Example Usage

Using `curl` to query IOC by ID:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/ioc_by_id?id=123456
Output:

üéØ IOC found by id entered:
IOC: badsite.com | Type: domain | Tags: phishing,malware
Threat type of IOC: phishing - Credential harvesting
Malware name in IOC: ZLoader
Level of malice carried: 95
...

```


‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Deployment
1. Dependencies
Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run Locally
```
python3 main.py
Server runs by default on port 8080.
```

3. Docker
If using Docker:
```
docker build -t threatwatcher .
docker run -p 8080:8080 threatwatcher
```

4. HAProxy Load Balancer (Sample config)
Basic /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg:

```
frontend http_front
   bind *:80
   default_backend http_back

backend http_back
   balance roundrobin
   server web01 192.168.1.10:8080 check
   server web02 192.168.1.11:8080 check
```

### Validation & Security
All user input is validated:

IPs, domains, hashes checked with regex

Malformed or missing parameters return clear error messages

Confidence level constrained to 0‚Äì100

No sensitive credentials are stored or transmitted(using .gitignore to exclude .env file containing API key)

### Challenges I encountered during development
1. For a CLI, I founnd it difficult to deploy it on the server
      It was hard but i tried using **http.server** which made it easier to get responses using a browser and not just from the command line
2. Responses on command line and after deploying were different; i only got json responses in the browser after deploying - the more I tried to fix it, the more I made my work complex and confusing.
      Honestly, I left it at that. I wish I made a simple webpage. I will work to change it using HTML, CSS, and javascript
